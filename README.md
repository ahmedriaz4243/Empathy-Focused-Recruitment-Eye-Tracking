# Project: Empathy Prediction using Eye-Tracking Data

This Python project aims to predict empathy levels in individuals based on eye-tracking data. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, including RandomForestRegressor, to build a predictive model.

### Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* pickle

###### You can install these libraries using the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pickle

* Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

* Copy code
- empathyhelper.py: Helper functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation
- output_data.csv: Directory containing the raw eye-tracking data files (CSV format)
* Usage
To run the project, simply execute the main_empathy.py script. The script will preprocess the data, extract relevant features, train the RandomForestRegressor model, and evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation.

Make sure to include all the necessary details to help users understand the project and its functionality.
